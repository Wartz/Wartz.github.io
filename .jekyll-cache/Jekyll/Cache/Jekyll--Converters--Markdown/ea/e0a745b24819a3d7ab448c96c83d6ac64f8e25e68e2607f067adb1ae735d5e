I"b<p>I paddled my C1 up the Tioughnioga from Youngâ€™s crossing on Monday. The water was at around 7 feet at 5PM and it was quite -fun- shall we say. Creeping upstream was not much of a workout despite the fast current. I spent more time sweeping and backpaddling to work my way around corners than I did paddling straight. Going downstream was like riding a roller coaster!</p>
