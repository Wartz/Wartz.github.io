I"π<p>I wasn‚Äôt happy with the battery life of my little lenovo s-21e. Previously on Windows 8.1 I‚Äôd get as much as 8 hrs of battery life. WIth arch installed, using a light i3 window manager, this was a paltry 2 hours. Unacceptable</p>

<p>The arch wiki revealed that installing the tlp package and using PowerTOP to optimize the system could help. After running</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>powertop --calibrate
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>powertop --autotune
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>this was improved to a solid 7.5 hours.</p>

<p>I‚Äôll take it.</p>

<p>Just one problem. No wifi! A reboot didn‚Äôt fix it. Running wifi-menu would just return ‚Äúno networks found‚Äù. I was pretty sure that the device was still working as it showed up in</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ip link
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>so the problem had to be software related. <em>Wifi-menu</em> is just a wrapper with a little ncurses ui, so I decided to go to the most basic way of starting up wifi networking.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ip link set *wifiadapter* up
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Bingo! This returned an error that the network was unable to start because RFkill was blocking the wifi adapter.</p>

<p>Turns out PowerTOP will do a soft wifi block to try and save battery life. Wat. Seems pointless. I guess if you‚Äôre on an airplane it could be handy. I should do more reading on the functionaly of powertop as well. Maybe I missed something while running it.</p>

<p>ANYWAYS, *deep breath*, simply running</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>rfkill unblock wifi
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>fixed the issues. Seems to hold up over a reboot too.</p>
